			The country is at an important juncture. It has completed the transition from a predominantly agrarian economy to a developed economy. It is operating at the leading edge of contemporary technology. A key element in taking the country forward and maintaining its growth momentum will be the highly skilled and competent global professionals.

			According to NASSCOM, each year over 3 million graduates and post-graduates are added to the Indian workforce.

			Of these only 25 percent of technical graduates and 10-15 percent of other graduates are considered employable by the rapidly growing IT and ITES segments.

			What we have today is a growing skills gap reflecting the slim availability of high-quality resource in India and the galloping pace of the country's service-driven economy, which is growing faster than most countries in the world.
